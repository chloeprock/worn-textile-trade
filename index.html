    <div id="about">
      <p>There is currently very limited publicly available data on the fashion industry.
        In particular,post-consumer waste in the fashion industry at a large scale is incredibly difficult to track
        through data.
        Monitoring trade flows of worn textiles helps us begin to get an idea of
        how many post-consumer textiles are floating around in the world -- and
        which countries the majority of these used clothing and fabric items end up in.
        Data on trade is public information, and not privately owned data in, for example,
        the hands of a single clothing brand.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although trade data does not allow us to track what happens to the textiles after they
        are traded, based on the literature, we do know a few likely fates for worn textiles:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>They are sold cheaply in secondhand markets. Often, what does not get sold in
          the goodwills of wealthier countries eventually ends up in the marketplaces of developing countries.</li>

        <li>If the textiles do not sell, they are disposed of. They may be formally landfilled or incinerated, but even
          wealthy countries generally lack sufficient facilities to formally landfill the huge quantities of used
          textiles that they
          export.
          <br>
          <br>
          This means that developing countries tend to bear the brunt of the final disposal of textiles in the global
          system -- they must find
          a way to dispose of
          mass quantities of worn textiles exported to them, and this often means informal/unregulated dumping.
        </li>

      </ul>
